Approximately 1600 people will take part in thisstudy. <br><br>If you agree to participate, you will be asked to watch movies of everyday events and answer some questions about those movies. You will also complete a short demographics questionnaire. You can skip any question on the demographics questionnaire that you prefer not to answer. The study should take approximately 45 minutes to complete.<br><br>We will keep the information you provide confidential. However, federal regulatory agencies and Washington University, including the Washington University Institutional Review Board (a committee that reviews and approves research studies) may inspect andcopy records pertaining to this research. Amazon Mechanical Turk keeps all your personal information private, and we will not have access to any of this information.The only information we will have other than what you provide in our questionnaires, is your Amazon Mechanical Turk worker ID. That means that this study is anonymous. No one, not even members of the research team, will know that the information you give came fromyou. <br><br>There are no known risks from being in this study, and you will not benefit personally.However, we hope that others may benefit in the future from what we learn as a result ofthis study. <br><br>You will not have any costs for being in this research study.<br><br>You will be paid for being in this research study.
