# Web-Based Event Segmentation Task

Event Segmentation Task [Zacks et al., 2001](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn0601_651) designed for web-based cognitive experiments conducted through a task-based service (i.e., Amazon Mechanical Turk).

This task was utilized in [Flores et al., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5542882/). Revisions of this code are to be expected. 

## Installation

All files should be hosted on a remote server with an accessible HTTPS address (if you want it to be publically accesible). You can then copy the files into a portion of the server that is accessible. In-depth testing should be performed on the server prior to usage of the scripts.

## USAGE

This task is designed to work with the Amazon Mechanical Turk environment. It can be modified to work with other services or a local network.
